This is my first project on TOP. I'm doing everything from the command line. Like the author said, that place becomes like home. From the web to the folder it is all done through CLI. Honestly I love it.

Committing was a little weird at first but eh, it is what it is. Also the authoritative language or whatever you call it is quite odd but the tips provided, "7 stairs to commit heaven" or whatever it was called was helpful. 

I've got way too many tabs open in my browser but I'm used to it (ADHD).

Hm, I don't think there's much else is there? I've learned HTML before, kind of. But this is my first full jump into it and I've jumped into a few too many rabbit holes, but that's ok. 

Thanks for reading this overly long and entirely unhelpful README. 

Ciao.
