                        Croissants are flaky, layered French pastry in the shape of a crescent. They’re loved by everyone and for a good reason! We’re talking cloud-like puff pastry, buttery, flaky, yeasty, chewy bread. It really is one of the most decadent things you can eat.

                        Croissant dough gets its many layers as a result of “laminating” the dough. This means we are rolling and folding over and over, giving you many thin layers of dough and butter. As you bake them, the butter melts and gives off steam. This puffs each paper-thin layer of dough up giving your croissants hundreds of buttery layers.
